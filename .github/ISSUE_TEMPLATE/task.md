name: Ticket
about: One roadmap item a build session can take - the interface, the end state, and what it waits on
labels: ready

## Problem

<what happens today, then the gap, then what the gap costs. Define each term at first use.>

## Interface

```lang
<the top-level call from outside, as agreed in planning>
```

New seam (repeat per new capability, method or type this ticket's level commits to; skip if none):

```lang
<the seam's signature and where it sits, named and signed — the builder picks how it is implemented, never what it is>
```

Input:

```json
<real values, no ellipsis>
```

Output (shape):

```json
<real fields; types stand in for values the builder produces>
```

Sibling: `<path:line>` or `none, new surface` · Where: `<the one folder the work belongs in>` · Anchor: `<file:line, diagram, or probe for each structural claim>`

## Done when

1. `<command>` prints `<expected output>`
2. <the next end-to-end case>
3. No file outside `<folder>` changed

## Constraints

- <a fact that shapes the build, with its consequence>

## Settle first

- <an unresolved question, or "none">

## Layers

<left empty; the build session posts its layer plan as a comment before the first edit>
